## Installation

This section covers compilation and installation of Unitex/GramLab on Windows and Unix-like systems. For the latest downloads please visit our [releases page]({{UNITEX_RELEASES_URL}}).

### Windows

A common way to install Unitex/GramLab is via the [setup installer]({{UNITEX_RELEASES_LATEST_BETA_WIN32_URL}}), then you have nothing to do but running the graphical interface by double-clicking on the file "Unitex.jar" (Classic IDE) or  "GramLab.jar" (Project-oriented IDE) located under the "App" directory. If you prefer a manual install, see the next section.

### Source Distribution Package

First, acquire the [source distribution package]({{UNITEX_RELEASES_LATEST_BETA_SOURCE_URL}}), then you must compile the Core sources. To do that, extract the files from the source zip file into a folder, go into the directory named  "Src/C++/build" and type:

```
make install
```

Then, you can launch the Classic IDE using the following command: 

```
java -jar YOUR_UNITEX_PATH/App/Unitex.jar &
```
